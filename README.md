# strava-to-todays-plan-sync

The purpose of this application will be to allow me to pull my workout data from Strava to sync back to Today's Plan. This will allow me to get the workout data for sources that do not push directly to Today's Plan, but do push to Strava (such as Rouvy). 

Currently this is only intended for personal use.
